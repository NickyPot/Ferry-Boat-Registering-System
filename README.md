# Ferry Boat Registering System

I made this application in my first semester of my first year in university. It is a console application in C++ that taught me the following concepts:

-Objects and classes

-Constructors

-Getters and setters

-Private types

-Constants

-Overloaded functions

-Pointers or passing by reference
